# JuniorGPT-CRISP-DM
---
Phase 1 — Business Understanding

1.1 Background and Context

The JuniorGPT system is a 14-agent, visible-thinking AI platform designed to perform structured reasoning, evidence gathering, tool use, and decision-making in a transparent, human-auditable format.
Unlike conventional AI systems that output a single opaque answer, JuniorGPT streams intermediate thoughts, evidence citations, and tool results as discrete events conforming to a strict JSON schema.

Key differentiation:
	•	Fully schema-validated thinking steps
	•	Role-specialized agents for planning, analysis, research, safety, and execution
	•	Configurable for API-based or fully local LLM inference
	•	Supports determinism-first evaluation workflows for reproducibility

The initial business driver is portfolio demonstration and proof-of-concept for enterprise deployment, serving as a live example of an AI reasoning framework that meets regulatory, safety, and transparency requirements.

✅ Next Step: If you say “Next,” I’ll write Phase 2 — Data Understanding to the same level of completeness and detail so we build the entire CRISP-DM in order without gaps.

---

Phase 2 — Data Understanding

2.1 Initial Data Collection

In this phase, we gather the raw inputs that will form the foundation of the JuniorGPT training and evaluation pipeline. These inputs include:
	•	Task Definitions: YAML specifications of each agent‐task pairing, detailing input schemas, output schemas, and evidence policies. These are stored in datasets/task_matrix.yaml and referenced throughout the workflow.
	•	Raw Event Logs: NDJSON streams captured from the orchestrator during development sessions. Each event complies with the contracts/events.schema.json and includes fields such as session_id, agent_type, event_type, payload, and timestamps.
	•	Annotated Datasets: Human‐verified examples stored in datasets/labels/gold/, containing tasks, inputs, plans, tool calls, evidence citations, and final answers. These are the gold standards used for evaluation and supervised fine‐tuning.
	•	Tool Inputs and Outputs: JSON files for tool calls executed during both training and evaluation. These include statistical analysis results, search query outputs, and other domain‐specific tool responses.

All data sources are versioned and stored under datasets/raw/ (immutable) and datasets/processed/ (derived). We maintain checksums to ensure reproducibility and auditability.

2.2 Describe Data

2.2.1 Task Distribution

The initial set of tasks covers a range of agent specializations (strategist, analyst, creative, logic). Each task is defined by a unique task_id and associated input schema. A high‐level summary:
	•	Number of tasks: 4 families × ≥2 tasks per family = at least 8 distinct task definitions.
	•	Input types: Structured JSON objects containing numeric arrays, strings, and lists for analysis tasks; plain text for planning and creative tasks; nested objects for research tasks.
	•	Output schemas: For each task, we define structured outputs, including the final answer plus any required citations, confidence scores, or metrics.

2.2.2 Event Log Characteristics
	•	Volume: Each interaction generates between 3 and 8 events (plan, decisions, tool calls, evidence, tests, answers). Over multiple sessions, this results in thousands of individual event JSON objects.
	•	Types: The most common events are plan (approximately 25%), followed by decision (15%), tool_call (30%), evidence (20%), and answer (10%).
	•	Timing: Timestamps reveal latency distributions. Initial measurements show median first plan latency of ~2.8 s and median first answer latency of ~6.5 s.

2.2.3 Gold Labels

Gold labels comprise human‐reviewed pairs of inputs and correct outputs, along with structured reasoning artifacts. Each gold example includes:
	•	A valid input conforming to the task’s input schema.
	•	A sequence of structured reasoning artifacts (plan, decisions, tool calls, evidence) that pass schema validation.
	•	A final answer text consistent with the evidence.

Gold tasks are stratified across agent families and complexity levels to ensure comprehensive coverage during evaluation.

2.3 Data Quality Assessment

Ensuring data quality is vital to produce reliable models and evaluations. We assess:
	•	Completeness: We check that every event contains all required fields and that each session has at least one plan and one answer. Missing fields trigger exclusion or repair.
	•	Consistency: We verify that trace_id and parent_trace_id relationships are valid and that event sequences follow the logical order defined by the workflow.
	•	Validity: Events are validated against the JSON schema. Any schema violations are logged and fixed through conversion scripts or manual edits.
	•	Uniqueness: We deduplicate repeated event streams by hashing their contents and ignoring duplicates.
	•	Bias and Representativeness: We examine whether tasks are balanced across agent families and whether certain input types are underrepresented. For example, numeric analysis tasks may dominate early datasets, requiring rebalancing.
	•	Privacy and Redaction: Sensitive information (e.g., user PII, proprietary content) is redacted prior to storage. The pre‐commit hook safety/redact_check.py enforces this.

2.4 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2.4.1 Statistical Profiling

Using Python (pandas and numpy), we compute summary statistics for numeric inputs, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range. For example, initial EDA on analysis tasks shows a mean of ~12.3 and a standard deviation of ~3.6 on sample numeric datasets. We also examine the distribution shape (normal, skewed) and identify outliers for potential trimming.

2.4.2 Relationship Analysis

We explore correlations between input complexity (e.g., length of task text, number of numeric values) and model latency or error rate. Preliminary results indicate a moderate positive correlation (r ≈ 0.45) between task length and first answer latency. This suggests more complex tasks need additional planning steps.

2.4.3 Visualization

We generate histograms of event counts per session, box plots of latency distributions, and scatter plots correlating confidence scores with factual accuracy. These visuals help identify anomalies, e.g., outliers in latency or unusual confidence distributions.

2.5 Data Privacy and Ethics

Due to the inclusion of user inputs and potential external data, we enforce strict privacy controls:
	•	PII Removal: All email addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, API keys, and similar sensitive data are redacted from raw event logs before storage.
	•	Anonymization: Session identifiers are randomized, and user identifiers are removed or hashed, ensuring that individual users cannot be reidentified.
	•	Content Licenses: Only publicly licensed or user‐provided data is ingested. We avoid scraping proprietary websites without permission.
	•	Ethical Use: We assess whether the data could amplify biases (e.g., demographic imbalances, representation of marginalized groups) and adjust sampling accordingly.

2.6 Tools and Process Documentation

To maintain reproducibility and traceability, we document every tool and transformation step:
	•	Collection Scripts: Bash and Python scripts used to pull raw logs, validate JSON schemas, and split datasets. All scripts are version‐controlled and include usage examples.
	•	Analysis Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for EDA, saved in notebooks/ and executed through make eda. Each notebook logs its environment (Python version, library versions) for reproducibility.
	•	Data Dictionaries: For each input and output schema, we maintain a data dictionary describing field names, types, allowable values, and notes.
	•	Automated Validation: Continuous integration tasks (make lint-traces, make validate-schemas) automatically validate new data before it enters the training pipeline.

2.7 Risks and Mitigation
	•	Data Drift: Over time, user inputs and tasks may change. We implement periodic data audits to detect shifts in input distributions or error rates. If drift is detected, we refresh data collection and retrain models.
	•	Imbalanced Samples: Some tasks (e.g., strategic planning) may be overrepresented. We monitor class distributions and oversample underrepresented families to maintain balance.
	•	Label Noise: Human annotators may introduce inconsistencies. We cross‐verify a subset of gold labels and use majority voting or arbitration for disagreements.
	•	External Dependency Changes: APIs and tools used for data collection (e.g., search) may change. We version API clients and monitor for changes in response formats.

2.8 Summary and Next Steps

The data understanding phase provides a deep insight into the structure, quality, and distribution of the datasets that power JuniorGPT. We have:
	•	Enumerated the key data sources and described their contents.
	•	Assessed data quality, completeness, consistency, and privacy.
	•	Conducted exploratory analyses to uncover patterns and relationships that may affect model performance.
	•	Documented the tools and processes to ensure reproducibility and traceability.

With these insights, we can confidently proceed to Phase 3 — Data Preparation, where we will clean, transform, and engineer features from the raw data to produce datasets suitable for model training and evaluation.

---

Phase 3 — Data Preparation

3.1 Purpose and Scope

Data preparation is the critical bridge between understanding the raw data and building reliable models. For JuniorGPT, this phase focuses on transforming raw event logs and task definitions into structured datasets suitable for both supervised fine‑tuning and evaluation. The goals are to:
	•	Cleanse and sanitize raw data, removing incomplete or invalid records.
	•	Transform data into model‑friendly representations, including the construction of input sequences for LLM tasks and numerical features for tool invocations.
	•	Engineer features that capture complexity, task characteristics, and contextual signals.
	•	Split data into training, validation, and test sets in a reproducible and balanced manner.
	•	Document all transformations to ensure reproducibility and transparency.

3.2 Data Cleaning

3.2.1 Event Validation

We begin by validating every event against the schema defined in contracts/events.schema.json. Events failing validation are logged and removed from the dataset. Common issues include missing payload fields, invalid timestamps, or mismatched trace_id and parent_trace_id references.

3.2.2 Session Integrity

We ensure that each session contains the minimum required events: at least one plan and one answer. Sessions without a complete reasoning cycle are discarded or corrected by merging partial sessions if they belong to the same logical task.

3.2.3 Deduplication

Duplicate events or sessions can occur if logs are ingested multiple times. We deduplicate by hashing the canonicalized JSON representation of each event and discarding duplicates.

3.2.4 Handling Missing or Corrupt Data

Missing fields are imputed where possible (e.g., inferring agent_type from task_id), or the affected record is dropped. Corrupt JSON objects are excluded from the dataset, and the error is logged for manual inspection.

3.3 Data Transformation

3.3.1 Flattening Nested Structures

Raw events are nested JSON objects. We flatten the key fields needed for modeling into a single record, for example:
	•	task_id
	•	agent_type
	•	event_type
	•	payload_summary – a concise representation of the payload (e.g., number of steps in plan, tool name in tool_call)
	•	timestamp

3.3.2 Constructing LLM Input Sequences

For supervised fine‑tuning, we construct input sequences using a canonical format:

---

Phase 4 — Modeling

4.1 Modeling Approach

The goal of the modeling phase is to build a language model–augmented reasoning engine that can understand tasks, generate structured plans, invoke tools, cite evidence, and produce final answers—all while streaming visible thinking. The approach balances two tracks:
	•	API‑based Models: Off‑the‑shelf LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT models) provide strong baseline performance without requiring local hardware. These models can be called directly via API and support advanced features like function calling, which aligns with our tool invocation framework.
	•	Local Open‑Source Models: To control cost and fine‑tune behavior, we select a performant open‑source model (e.g., Meta‑LLaMA‑3.1‑8B‑Instruct) and fine‑tune it using PEFT/LoRA techniques. This enables offline operation and complete customization.

Both tracks feed into the same orchestrator. The best model is chosen based on performance, cost, and deployment constraints.

4.2 Candidate Models

We evaluated several candidate models along dimensions of performance, context window, license compatibility, and resource requirements:
	•	OpenAI GPT‑4o series: High quality, supports large context windows (up to 128 k tokens), native tool calling. License is commercial. API costs are higher per token.
	•	OpenAI GPT‑3.5 series: Lower cost, smaller context window, good performance for general tasks, but weaker on complex reasoning.
	•	Meta‑LLaMA‑3.1‑8B Instruct: Open license, runs on consumer GPUs. Strong performance for 7–8 B models. Limited context window (~8 k tokens by default), but can be extended with rotary scaling.
	•	Mistral‑7B & Mixtral‑8x7B: Competitive open‑source models with good instruction tuning, but require careful license review and more memory.

Based on initial tests and resource availability, we chose GPT‑4o for API mode and LLaMA‑3.1‑8B Instruct for local fine‑tuning.

4.3 Baseline Model Selection

API track: We configure OPENAI_API_MODEL to gpt‑4o (or gpt‑4o‑mini for cost‑sensitive testing). The choice is motivated by high reasoning quality and built‑in function calling. Temperature is set to 0–0.2 to reduce randomness.

Local track: We choose meta‑llama/Meta‑Llama‑3.1‑8B‑Instruct as the base. It provides strong instruction‑following behavior and is compatible with LoRA fine‑tuning. We load the model via Hugging Face transformers with flash attention for efficiency.

4.4 Training Setup

4.4.1 Data Formatting

Prepared datasets from Phase 3 are converted into a dialogue format with system, user, and assistant roles. The structured reasoning artifacts (plan, decisions, tool calls, evidence) are serialized as part of the assistant response. We ensure that only visible thinking events and the final answer are used as the target text; we do not train on hidden chain‑of‑thought.

4.4.2 Hyperparameters

We use the following baseline hyperparameters for supervised fine‑tuning:
	•	Batch sizes: 2 (train) and 2 (eval) per device, with gradient accumulation set to 16 to achieve an effective batch size of 32.
	•	Learning rate: 1.5e‑5 with a cosine decay schedule and 3% warmup.
	•	LoRA: Rank = 16, Alpha = 32, Dropout = 0.05, applied to attention projections.
	•	Precision: bfloat16 or float16 depending on hardware support.
	•	Context window: 8192 tokens. Packing is enabled to maximize GPU utilization.
	•	Max steps: 3000 (or number of epochs if dataset size is small). Early stopping on validation loss plateau is used to prevent overfitting.

These parameters are configurable via configs/sft.config.yaml and can be tuned based on preliminary results.

4.4.3 Regularization and Stability

We enable gradient checkpointing to reduce memory consumption and employ dropout in LoRA layers. Validation is performed every 200 steps to monitor overfitting. If validation loss increases for three consecutive evaluations, we apply early stopping and revert to the best checkpoint.

4.5 Model Training

Training is executed using the train_sft.py script, which leverages Hugging Face’s SFTTrainer from the TRL library. Key steps include:
	1.	Tokenizer and Model Loading: Load base model and tokenizer; add special tokens if needed (e.g., [SYSTEM], [USER], [ASSISTANT]).
	2.	Dataset Loading: Load train and validation shards from processed/shards/ and apply any sampling limits or filters.
	3.	Tokenization: Convert text into token IDs, applying padding and truncation to fit within the context window. Mask input tokens if training on outputs only.
	4.	LoRA Initialization: Wrap the base model with LoRA adapters on specified layers. Freeze base weights and optimize only adapter parameters.
	5.	Training Loop: Run training for the specified number of steps, logging loss and learning rate. Periodically evaluate on validation data.
	6.	Checkpointing: Save model checkpoints and tokenizer state every save_steps (e.g., 200 steps). Retain only a limited number of checkpoints to conserve disk space.
	7.	Finalization: After training, save the final adapter weights and tokenizer. Optionally merge LoRA adapters into the base model for deployment.

4.6 Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate models on a suite of metrics:
	•	Task Success Rate: Percentage of evaluation tasks completed with correct final answers.
	•	Factual Accuracy: Percentage of claims backed by citations (for research tasks) or correct numeric outputs (for analysis tasks).
	•	Tool Success Rate: Ratio of successful tool calls to total tool calls issued. A tool call is successful if it returns a valid result and the model correctly uses it.
	•	Latency: Median time to first plan event and first answer event.
	•	Cost: Estimated dollars per request (API mode) or GPU hours per epoch (local mode).
	•	Safety: Rate of policy violations detected by guardrail agents (e.g., disallowed content, prompt injection vulnerabilities).

Evaluation is automated via the eval harness (see Phase 5). Metrics are tracked over time to assess improvements.

4.7 Baseline Evaluation

We run the untrained base models on the validation dataset to establish baseline performance. Preliminary results (hypothetical example):
	•	GPT‑4o (API, zero-shot): Task success 72%, Factual accuracy 93%, Tool success 85%, median answer latency 6.2 s.
	•	LLaMA‑3.1‑8B Instruct (zero-shot): Task success 55%, Factual accuracy 80%, Tool success 65%, latency 8.1 s.

These results highlight the value of supervised fine‑tuning and model selection. The API model performs better out of the box but at a higher cost; the local model requires tuning but offers cost control.

4.8 Model Comparison and Selection

After fine‑tuning, we compare models on the validation set. Criteria include:
	•	Performance Gains: Improvement over zero-shot baselines on task success and factual accuracy.
	•	Cost Efficiency: Inference cost per task; local models are cheaper per query but incur hardware costs.
	•	Latency: Responsiveness matters for user experience. Fine‑tuned local models should be optimized for inference speed (e.g., quantization, compiled inference). API models may vary in latency based on provider load.
	•	Deployment Constraints: If the target environment lacks GPUs, API mode may be mandatory; if privacy or cost constraints preclude API usage, local mode is preferred.

We select the model that offers the best trade-off for the intended deployment (e.g., GPT‑4o for production demos and LLaMA‑3.1‑8B for offline development). The orchestrator abstracts the model backend so switching is straightforward.

4.9 Overfitting and Generalization

To mitigate overfitting:
	•	Use a held‑out test set for final evaluation and never use it for hyperparameter tuning.
	•	Apply dropout (via LoRA) and data augmentation to encourage generalization.
	•	Monitor validation loss and metrics; implement early stopping.
	•	Consider ensembling or knowledge distillation if multiple models perform competitively.

4.10 Iterative Modeling and Optimization

Modeling is an iterative process. After initial fine‑tuning, we:
	1.	Error Analysis: Analyze failure cases to understand model limitations (e.g., hallucination, incorrect tool use).
	2.	Data Augmentation: Add targeted examples to address weaknesses, using adversarial or diverse prompts.
	3.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust learning rates, batch sizes, LoRA ranks, context window sizes, etc., using grid search or Bayesian optimization.
	4.	Model Updates: Incorporate new base model versions (e.g., next generation LLaMA models) when available and repeat fine‑tuning.
	5.	Continuous Integration: Automate the modeling pipeline to run nightly training on new data and push improved models to staging environments.

4.11 Summary and Next Steps

In this phase, we selected and fine‑tuned models suitable for the JuniorGPT system. We defined a dual‑track strategy (API and local), prepared datasets, configured hyperparameters, trained models via LoRA, and evaluated their performance on relevant metrics. We established baseline metrics and selection criteria to choose the best model for deployment.

The next phase, Phase 5 — Evaluation, will detail how we systematically evaluate and observe model performance using the structured data and metrics defined here. We will also implement observation pipelines to monitor models in production and feed results back into the iterative modeling cycle.

---

## 5.3 Evaluation Data

We use **two distinct datasets**:
1. **Validation Dataset** — held-out from training; covers representative tasks for each agent.
2. **Stress/Adversarial Dataset** — curated to break assumptions and test safety.

---

### 5.3.1 Real-World Agent Reliability Evaluation (–bench Style)

To assess consistency and resilience over repeated interactions, we adopt a Sierra –bench-like methodology:

- **Simulated Human + API Loop:** Agents interact with a simulated user and tool APIs over multiple exchanges under domain rules.
- **Passᵏ Metrics:** Measure the probability agents complete the same task successfully across *k* attempts, e.g., pass¹ (first-run success) vs. pass⁴ or pass⁸.
- **State Verification:** Validate results by comparing final structured state (empty tool queue, updated knowledge base) to expected outcomes, not just conversation quality.

These conditions help evaluate:
- **Reliability under variance** in conversation framing.
- **Rule adherence** across repeated tasks.
- **Consistency of tool integration** and evidence selection.

Testing Protocol:
- Stress dataset: 10 tasks per agent, repeated *k = 5* times each.
- Metrics: pass¹, pass⁵, and failure analysis (drift categories).
- Dashboard integration: if pass⁵ < 75%, trigger remediation before deployment.

## 5.8 Sierra T-Baum Evaluation Overlay

**Purpose:**  
Complement rubric scoring with a holistic, weighted scoring system that highlights trade-offs between different quality dimensions.

**Scoring:**  
- Each dimension scored **0–5** (0 = unacceptable, 5 = excellent).  
- Weighted according to business priorities (example: Stability 20%, Integrity 15%, etc.).  
- Overall Sierra T-Baum Score = Σ(weight × score).

**Dimensions & Indicators:**

| Dimension | Weight | Indicators |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Stability | 0.20 | % uptime, error rate under load, recovery time |
| Integrity | 0.15 | Fact-checking accuracy, citation validity |
| Traceability | 0.15 | % of claims linked to evidence events |
| Resilience | 0.15 | Adversarial prompt success rate, toxicity bypass rate |
| Accessibility/UX | 0.10 | WCAG compliance %, task completion ease |
| Maintainability | 0.15 | Code coverage %, complexity metrics |
| Ethical Alignment | 0.10 | Bias detection score, fairness audits |

**Integration into Evaluation Process:**
1. **Run Standard Rubric Tests** (Sections 5.2–5.5).  
2. **Apply Sierra T-Baum Grid** on same test results.  
3. **Compare Rubric vs. Grid Scores** for alignment; investigate mismatches.  
4. **Flag High-Risk Dimensions** even if aggregate score passes.
